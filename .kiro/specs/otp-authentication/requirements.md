# OTP Authentication Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a robust OTP (One-Time Password) authentication system that provides secure email-based verification for user registration and login processes. The system should handle OTP generation, delivery, verification, and cleanup with proper error handling and user experience considerations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OTP Generation and Storage

**User Story:** As a system, I want to generate secure OTPs and store them temporarily, so that users can verify their email addresses during registration and authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests OTP THEN the system SHALL generate a 6-digit numeric OTP
2. WHEN OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL store it with email, timestamp, and expiration time
3. WHEN OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL set expiration time to 10 minutes from creation
4. WHEN OTP already exists for an email THEN the system SHALL replace the old OTP with new one
5. IF OTP generation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: OTP Email Delivery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive OTP via email, so that I can verify my email address during registration or login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL send email containing the OTP to user's email address
2. WHEN email is sent THEN the system SHALL use a professional email template with clear instructions
3. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL return error message and not store the OTP
4. WHEN email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL return success confirmation to frontend
5. IF email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error message

### Requirement 3: OTP Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want to verify my OTP, so that I can complete my registration or login process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits OTP THEN the system SHALL validate the OTP against stored value
2. WHEN OTP is correct and not expired THEN the system SHALL mark verification as successful
3. WHEN OTP is verified successfully THEN the system SHALL delete the OTP from storage
4. WHEN OTP is incorrect THEN the system SHALL return error message without deleting OTP
5. WHEN OTP is expired THEN the system SHALL return expiration error and delete the OTP
6. WHEN OTP doesn't exist for email THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
7. IF verification is called multiple times simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions properly

### Requirement 4: OTP Resend Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to resend OTP if I didn't receive it or it expired, so that I can complete the verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests OTP resend THEN the system SHALL generate new OTP and invalidate old one
2. WHEN resend is requested THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting (max 3 attempts per 15 minutes)
3. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return rate limit error message
4. WHEN resend is successful THEN the system SHALL send new OTP via email
5. IF resend fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous valid OTP if it exists

### Requirement 5: Registration with OTP Integration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with OTP verification, so that my email is verified before account creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits registration form THEN the system SHALL send OTP to provided email
2. WHEN user verifies OTP THEN the system SHALL create user account with verified email status
3. WHEN OTP verification fails THEN the system SHALL not create user account
4. WHEN registration is completed THEN the system SHALL return authentication token and user data
5. IF user already exists THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
6. WHEN registration process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary data

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and feedback, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any OTP operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight specific field errors
4. WHEN loading operations occur THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show success confirmations
6. IF unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and show generic user message

### Requirement 7: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OTP data to be secure and properly cleaned up, so that user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP is stored THEN the system SHALL not log OTP values in production
2. WHEN OTP expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up expired OTPs
3. WHEN OTP is used THEN the system SHALL immediately delete it from storage
4. WHEN system restarts THEN the system SHALL maintain OTP data persistence
5. IF brute force attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL implement account lockout
6. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate request authenticity

### Requirement 8: Frontend User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth and intuitive OTP verification interface, so that I can easily complete the verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP input is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide 6 individual input fields
2. WHEN user types in OTP field THEN the system SHALL auto-advance to next field
3. WHEN user pastes OTP THEN the system SHALL automatically fill all fields
4. WHEN OTP is submitted THEN the system SHALL disable submit button to prevent double submission
5. WHEN verification is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading state
6. WHEN timer is active THEN the system SHALL display countdown for resend availability
7. IF verification fails THEN the system SHALL clear OTP fields and allow retry
